## Local setup

You need a file called .env.development in your root while developing. All .env files are gitignored. It should look like this:

    CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID="the space id goes here"
    CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN="the access token goes here"

You can find these in the API key section of the settings in Contentful.
